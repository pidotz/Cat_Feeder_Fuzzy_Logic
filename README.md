Designed to feed the cat based on its breed, body condition, activity level, and the remaining weight of food in the bowl. The output determines the timing of the servo to open and close, facilitating the dispensing of food into the bowl. 
This project was achieve by using Arduino IDE, MatLab, and various hardware components.  

This project requires electrical components:
1) Arduino MEGA 2560
2) Weight Sensor (1Kg Load Cell)
3) Amplifier
4) Servo Motor
5) ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
